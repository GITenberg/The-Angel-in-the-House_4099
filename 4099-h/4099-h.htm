vii</span>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> could be but one answer to
the suggestion of Mr. Coventry Patmore that his &ldquo;Angel in
the House&rdquo; might usefully have a place in this
&ldquo;National Library.&rdquo;&nbsp; The suggestion was made
with the belief that wide and cheap diffusion would not take from
the value of a copyright library edition, while the best use of
writing is fulfilled by the spreading of verse dedicated to the
sacred love of home.&nbsp; The two parts of the Poem appeared in
1854 and 1856, were afterwards elaborately revised, and have
since obtained a permanent place among the Home Books of the
English People.&nbsp; Our readers will join, surely, in thanks to
the author for the present he has made us.</p>

<h3>THE PROLOGUE.</h3>
<h4>1</h4>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Mine</span> is no
horse with wings, to gain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The region of the spheral chime;<br />
He does but drag a rumbling wain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Cheer&rsquo;d by the coupled bells of rhyme;<br />
And if at Fame&rsquo;s bewitching note<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My homely Pegasus pricks an ear,<br />
The world&rsquo;s cart-collar hugs his throat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he&rsquo;s too wise to prance or
rear.&rsquo;</p>
<h4>2</h4>
<p class="poetry">Thus ever answer&rsquo;d Vaughan his Wife,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, more than he, desired his fame;<br />
But, in his heart, his thoughts were rife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How for her sake to earn a name.<br />
<a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>With bays
poetic three times crown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And other college honours won,<br />
He, if he chose, might be renown&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He had but little doubt, she none;<br />
And in a loftier phrase he talk&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With her, upon their Wedding-Day,<br />
(The eighth), while through the fields they walk&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their children shouting by the way.</p>
<h4>3</h4>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Not careless of the gift of song,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor out of love with noble fame,<br />
I, meditating much and long<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What I should sing, how win a name,<br />
Considering well what theme unsung,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; What reason worth the cost of rhyme,<br />
Remains to loose the poet&rsquo;s tongue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In these last days, the dregs of time,<br />
Learn that to me, though born so late,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; There does, beyond desert, befall<br />
(May my great fortune make me great!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The first of themes, sung last of all.<br />
In green and undiscover&rsquo;d ground,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet near where many others sing,<br />
I have the very well-head found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whence gushes the Pierian Spring.&rsquo;</p>
<h4><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>4</h4>
<p class="poetry">Then she: &lsquo;What is it, Dear?&nbsp; The
Life<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Arthur, or Jerusalem&rsquo;s Fall?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Neither: your gentle self, my Wife,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And love, that grows from one to all.<br />
And if I faithfully proclaim<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of these the exceeding worthiness,<br />
Surely the sweetest wreath of Fame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Shall, to your hope, my brows caress;<br />
And if, by virtue of my choice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this, the most heart-touching theme<br />
That ever tuned a poet&rsquo;s voice,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I live, as I am bold to dream,<br />
To be delight to many days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And into silence only cease<br />
When those are still, who shared their bays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With Laura and with Beatrice,<br />
Imagine, Love, how learned men<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Will deep-conceiv&rsquo;d devices find,<br />
Beyond my purpose and my ken,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An ancient bard of simple mind.<br />
You, Sweet, his Mistress, Wife, and Muse,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were you for mortal woman meant?<br />
Your praises give a hundred clues<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To mythological intent!<br />
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>And,
severing thus the truth from trope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In you the Commentators see<br />
Outlines occult of abstract scope,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A future for philosophy!<br />
Your arm&rsquo;s on mine! these are the meads<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In which we pass our living days;<br />
There Avon runs, now hid with reeds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now brightly brimming pebbly bays;<br />
Those are our children&rsquo;s songs that come<br />

<i>The Impossibility</i>.</h5>
<p class="poetry">Lo, love&rsquo;s obey&rsquo;d by all.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all should know what they obey,<br />
Lest erring conscience damp delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And folly laugh our joys away.<br />
Thou Primal Love, who grantest wings<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And voices to the woodland birds,<br />
Grant me the power of saying things<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too simple and too sweet for words!</p>

<i>Love&rsquo;s Really</i>.</h5>
<p class="poetry">I walk, I trust, with open eyes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve travell&rsquo;d half my worldly

And in the way behind me lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Much vanity and some remorse;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirits, tho&rsquo; match&rsquo;d like hand and

I&rsquo;ve blush&rsquo;d for love&rsquo;s abode, the heart;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But have not disbelieved in love;<br />
Nor unto love, sole mortal thing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of worth immortal, done the wrong<br />
To count it, with the rest that sing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unworthy of a serious song;<br />
And love is my reward; for now,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When most of dead&rsquo;ning time complain,<br />
The myrtle blooms upon my brow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its odour quickens all my brain.</p>

<i>The Poet&rsquo;s Confidence</i>.</h5>
<p class="poetry">The richest realm of all the earth<br />

Lo, I, like Joshua, now go forth<br />

I will not hearken blame or praise;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For so should I dishonour do<br />
To that sweet Power by which these Lays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone are lovely, good, and true;<br />
Nor credence to the world&rsquo;s cries give,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which ever preach and still prevent<br />
Pure passion&rsquo;s high prerogative<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make, not follow, precedent.<br />
<a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>From
love&rsquo;s abysmal ether rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If I to men have here made known<br />
New truths, they, like new stars, were there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before, though not yet written down.<br />
Moving but as the feelings move,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I run, or loiter with delight,<br />
Or pause to mark where gentle Love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Persuades the soul from height to height.<br />
Yet, know ye, though my words are gay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As David&rsquo;s dance, which Michal
scorn&rsquo;d.<br />
If kindly you receive the Lay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You shall be sweetly help&rsquo;d and

<h4>THE CATHEDRAL CLOSE.</h4>
<h5>1</h5>
<p class="poetry">Once more I came to Sarum Close,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With joy half memory, half desire,<br />
And breathed the sunny wind that rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blew the shadows o&rsquo;er the Spire,<br />
And toss&rsquo;d the lilac&rsquo;s scented plumes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And sway&rsquo;d the chestnut&rsquo;s thousand
cones,<br />
And fill&rsquo;d my nostrils with perfumes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And shaped the clouds in waifs and zones,<br />
<a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>And wafted
down the serious strain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Sarum bells, when, true to time,<br />
I reach&rsquo;d the Dean&rsquo;s, with heart and brain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That trembled to the trembling chime.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="poetry">&rsquo;Twas half my home, six years ago.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The six years had not alter&rsquo;d it:<br />
Red-brick and ashlar, long and low,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With dormers and with oriels lit.<br />
Geranium, lychnis, rose array&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The windows, all wide open thrown;<br />
And some one in the Study play&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Wedding-March of Mendelssohn.<br />
And there it was I last took leave:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas Christmas: I remember&rsquo;d now<br />
The cruel girls, who feign&rsquo;d to grieve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took down the evergreens; and how<br />
The holly into blazes woke<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The fire, lighting the large, low room,<br />
A dim, rich lustre of old oak<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And crimson velvet&rsquo;s glowing gloom.<br />
No change had touch&rsquo;d Dean Churchill: kind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By widowhood more than winters bent,<br />
And settled in a cheerful mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As still forecasting heaven&rsquo;s content.<br />
<a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Well might
his thoughts be fix&rsquo;d on high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she was there!&nbsp; Within her face<br />
Humility and dignity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were met in a most sweet embrace.<br />
She seem&rsquo;d expressly sent below<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To teach our erring minds to see<br />
The rhythmic change of time&rsquo;s swift flow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As part of still eternity.<br />
Her life, all honour, observed, with awe<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which cross experience could not mar,<br />
The fiction of the Christian law<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all men honourable are;<br />
And so her smile at once conferr&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; High flattery and benign reproof;<br />
And I, a rude boy, strangely stirr&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew courtly in my own behoof.<br />
The years, so far from doing her wrong,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Anointed her with gracious balm,<br />
And made her brows more and more young<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With wreaths of amaranth and palm.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="poetry">Was this her eldest, Honor; prude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who would not let me pull the swing;<br />
Who, kiss&rsquo;d at Christmas, call&rsquo;d me rude,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, sobbing low, refused to sing?<br />
<a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>How
changed!&nbsp; In shape no slender Grace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But Venus; milder than the dove;<br />
Her mother&rsquo;s air; her Norman face;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her large sweet eyes, clear lakes of love.<br />
Mary I knew.&nbsp; In former time<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ailing and pale, she thought that bliss<br />
Was only for a better clime,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, heavenly overmuch, scorn&rsquo;d this.<br />
I, rash with theories of the right,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which stretch&rsquo;d the tether of my Creed,<br />
But did not break it, held delight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Half discipline.&nbsp; We disagreed.<br />
She told the Dean I wanted grace.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Now she was kindest of the three,<br />
And soft wild roses deck&rsquo;d her face.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, what, was this my Mildred, she<br />
To herself and all a sweet surprise?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My Pet, who romp&rsquo;d and roll&rsquo;d a hoop?<br

I wonder&rsquo;d where those daisy eyes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Had found their touching curve and droop.</p>
<h5>5</h5>
<p class="poetry">Unmannerly times!&nbsp; But now we sat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stranger than strangers; till I caught<br />
And answer&rsquo;d Mildred&rsquo;s smile; and that<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Spread to the rest, and freedom brought.<br />
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>The Dean
talk&rsquo;d little, looking on,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of three such daughters justly vain.<br />
What letters they had had from Bonn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said Mildred, and what plums from Spain!<br />
By Honor I was kindly task&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To excuse my never coming down<br />
From Cambridge; Mary smiled and ask&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were Kant and Goethe yet outgrown?<br />
And, pleased, we talk&rsquo;d the old days o&rsquo;er;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, parting, I for pleasure sigh&rsquo;d.<br />
To be there as a friend, (since more),<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Seem&rsquo;d then, seems still, excuse for pride;<br
/>
For something that abode endued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With temple-like repose, an air<br />
Of life&rsquo;s kind purposes pursued<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With order&rsquo;d freedom sweet and fair.<br />
A tent pitch&rsquo;d in a world not right<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It seem&rsquo;d, whose inmates, every one,<br />
On tranquil faces bore the light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of duties beautifully done,<br />
And humbly, though they had few peers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Kept their own laws, which seem&rsquo;d to be<br />
The fair sum of six thousand years&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Traditions of civility.</p>

All forces of the sea and air,<br />

Elated oft by such free songs,<br />

But when I look on her and hope<br />

No mystery of well-woven speech,<br />

Nay, might I utter my conceit,<br />

For she&rsquo;s so simply, subtly sweet,<br />

Nor happier post than this I ask,<br />

On wings of love uplifted free,<br />

I&rsquo;ll teach how noble man should be<br />

in her may move the more<br />

And, as geranium, pink, or rose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is thrice itself through power of art,<br />
So may my happy skill disclose<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; New fairness even in her fair heart;<br />
Until that churl shall nowhere be<br />

Of her affecting majesty,<br />

Until (for who may hope too much<br />

Our lifted lives at last shall touch<br />

<p class="poetry">Whene&rsquo;er I come where ladies are,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Withheld in ice from the ocean&rsquo;s roar,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Alike, too dull to be dismay&rsquo;d,<br />
Yet, if I come where ladies are,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How sad soever I was before,<br />
Then is my sadness banish&rsquo;d far,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I am like that ship no more;<br />
Or like that ship if the ice-field splits,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Burst by the sudden polar Spring,<br />
And all thank God with their warming wits,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kiss each other and dance and sing,<br />
And hoist fresh sails, that make the breeze<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blow them along the liquid sea,<br />
Out of the North, where life did freeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Into the haven where they would be.</p>

should!&rsquo;<br />
I worshipp&rsquo;d Kate with all my will,<br />

<p class="poetry">One morning, after Church, I walk&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone with Mary on the lawn,<br />
And felt myself, howe&rsquo;er we talk&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To grave themes delicately drawn.<br />
When she, delighted, found I knew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More of her peace than she supposed,<br />
Our confidences heavenwards grew,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like fox-glove buds, in pairs disclosed.<br />
Our former faults did we confess,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Our ancient feud was more than heal&rsquo;d,<br />
And, with the woman&rsquo;s eagerness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For amity full-sign&rsquo;d and seal&rsquo;d,<br />
She, offering up for sacrifice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her heart&rsquo;s reserve, brought out to show<br />
Some verses, made when she was ice<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To all but Heaven, six years ago;<br />
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>Since
happier grown!&nbsp; I took and read<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The neat-writ lines.&nbsp; She, void of guile,<br />
Too late repenting, blush&rsquo;d, and said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I must not think about the style.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Day after day, until to-day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Imaged the others gone before,<br />
The same dull task, the weary way,<br />

o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The thwarted thirst, too faintly
felt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For joy&rsquo;s well-nigh forgotten life,<br />
The restless heart, which, when I knelt,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made of my worship barren strife.</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Ah, whence to-day&rsquo;s so sweet
release,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; This clearance light of all my care,<br />
This conscience free, this fertile peace,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; These softly folded wings of prayer,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;This calm and more than conquering
love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With which nought evil dares to cope,<br />
This joy that lifts no glance above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For faith too sure, too sweet for hope?</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;O, happy time, too happy change,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It will not live, though fondly nurst!<br />
Full soon the sun will seem as strange<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As now the cloud which seems dispersed.&rsquo;</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And well she knew that I knew well<br />
Her grace with silence to requite;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, answering now the luncheon bell,<br />
I laugh&rsquo;d at Mildred&rsquo;s laugh, which made<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All melancholy wrong, its mood<br />
Such sweet self-confidence display&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; So glad a sense of present good.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="poetry">I laugh&rsquo;d and sigh&rsquo;d: for I

And thus to me, who had in sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The happy chance upon the cards,<br />
Each beauty blossom&rsquo;d in the light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of tender personal regards;<br />
And, in the records of my breast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Red-letter&rsquo;d, eminently fair,<br />
Stood sixteen, who, beyond the rest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By turns till then had been my care:<br />
At Berlin three, one at St. Cloud,<br />

In judgment of the moment, she<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose daisy eyes had learn&rsquo;d to droop.<br />
Her very faults my fancy fired;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My loving will, so thwarted, grew;<br />
And, bent on worship, I admired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whate&rsquo;er she was, with partial view.<br />
And yet when, as to-day, her smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was prettiest, I could not but note<br />
Honoria, less admired the while,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was lovelier, though from love remote.</p>

How, self-consign&rsquo;d with lavish will,<br />

For love is substance, truth the form;<br />

But blindest love is sweet and warm,<br />

And therefore in herself she stands<br />

Her happy virtues taking hands,<br />

How often one dead joy appears<br />

<p class="poetry">How vilely &rsquo;twere to misdeserve<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The poet&rsquo;s gift of perfect speech,<br />
In song to try, with trembling nerve,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The limit of its utmost reach,<br />
Only to sound the wretched praise<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of what to-morrow shall not be;<br />
So mocking with immortal bays<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cross-bones of mortality!<br />
I do not thus.&nbsp; My faith is fast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That all the loveliness I sing<br />
Is made to bear the mortal blast,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And blossom in a better Spring.<br />
Doubts of eternity ne&rsquo;er cross<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lover&rsquo;s mind, divinely clear;<br />
<i>For ever</i> is the gain or loss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which maddens him with hope or fear:<br />
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>So trifles
serve for his relief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And trifles make him sick and pale;<br />
And yet his pleasure and his grief<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Are both on a majestic scale.<br />
The chance, indefinitely small,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of issue infinitely great,<br />
Eclipses finite interests all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And has the dignity of fate.</p>

And scorn as low their human lot,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With frantic pride, too blind to see<br />
That standing on the head makes not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Either for ease or dignity!<br />
But fools shall feel like fools to find<br />

<p class="poetry">To soothe my heart I, feigning, seized<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A pen, and, showering tears, declared<br />
My unfeign&rsquo;d passion; sadly pleased<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only to dream that so I dared.<br />
Thus was the fervid truth confess&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But wild with paradox ran the plea.<br />
As wilfully in hope depress&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet bold beyond hope&rsquo;s warranty:</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; And do not deafly shut the door!<br />
I claim no right to speak; I trust<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercy, not right; yet who has more?<br />
For, if more love makes not more fit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of claimants here none&rsquo;s more nor less,<br />
Since your great worth does not permit<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Degrees in our unworthiness.<br />
Yet, if there&rsquo;s aught that can be done<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With arduous labour of long years,<br />
By which you&rsquo;ll say that you&rsquo;ll be won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O tell me, and I&rsquo;ll dry my tears.<br />
Ah, no; if loving cannot move,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; If signs suffice let these avail:<br />
<a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>Your name

The winds that in the garden toss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The Guelder-roses give me pain,<br />
Alarm me with the dread of loss,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Exhaust me with the dream of gain;<br />
I&rsquo;m troubled by the clouds that move;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Tired by the breath which I respire;<br />
And ever, like a torch, my love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus agitated, flames the higher;<br />
All&rsquo;s hard that has not you for goal;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I scarce can move my hand to write,<br />
For love engages all my soul,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leaves the body void of might;<br />
The wings of will spread idly, as do<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The bird&rsquo;s that in a vacuum lies;<br />
My breast, asleep with dreams of you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgets to breathe, and bursts in sighs;<br />
I see no rest this side the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No rest nor hope, from you apart;<br />
Your life is in the rose you gave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its perfume suffocates my heart;<br />
There&rsquo;s no refreshment in the breeze;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The heaven o&rsquo;erwhelms me with its blue;<br />
I faint beside the dancing seas;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Winds, skies, and waves are only you;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Never have met!&nbsp; What calm, what ease!<br />
Nay, but, alas, this remedy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were ten times worse than the disease!<br />
For when, indifferent, I pursue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The world&rsquo;s best pleasures for relief,<br />
My heart, still sickening back to you,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Finds none like memory of its grief;<br />
And, though &rsquo;twere very hell to hear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You felt such misery as I,<br />
All good, save you, were far less dear!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than is that ill with which I die<br />
Where&rsquo;er I go, wandering forlorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; You are the world&rsquo;s love, life, and glee:<br

Oh, wretchedness not to be borne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If she that&rsquo;s Love should not love
me!&rsquo;</p>

But, now and then, in cheek and eyes,<br />

see<br />
The gladness of the primal grace,<br />

Of all she was, the least not less<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Delighted the devoted eye;<br />
No fold or fashion of her dress<br />

I could not else than grieve.&nbsp; What cause?<br />

How laps&rsquo;d mortality had numb&rsquo;d<br />

Till, one vague rack along my sky,<br />

And I despised the Druid rocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That scowl&rsquo;d their chill gloom from above,<br

Like churls whose stolid wisdom mocks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The lightness of immortal love.<br />
And, as we talk&rsquo;d, my spirit quaff&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sparkling winds; the candid skies<br />
At our untruthful strangeness laugh&rsquo;d;<br />

More form and more fair stateliness<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Her love-lit form and gentle state.<br />
Her dress had brush&rsquo;d this wicket; here<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She turn&rsquo;d her face, and laugh&rsquo;d, with
light<br />
Like moonbeams on a wavering mere.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weary beforehand of the night,<br />
I went; the blackbird, in the wood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Talk&rsquo;d by himself, and eastward grew<br />
In heaven the symbol of my mood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where one bright star engross&rsquo;d the blue.</p>

herself be woo&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And wake the foolish from his dream,<br />
She must be glad as well as good,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And must not only be, but seem.<br />
Beauty and joy are hers by right;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, knowing this, I wonder less<br />
That she&rsquo;s so scorn&rsquo;d, when falsely dight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In misery and ugliness.<br />
What&rsquo;s that which Heaven to man endears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And that which eyes no sooner see<br />
Than the heart says, with floods of tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the thing which I would
be!&rsquo;<br />
Not childhood, full of frown and fret;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Not youth, impatient to disown<br />
Those visions high, which to forget<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were worse than never to have known;<br />

And boasters of celestial gleams<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Go stumbling aye for want of eyes;<br />
Not patriots or people&rsquo;s men,<br />

Than ever sought Adullam&rsquo;s den,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; But find &rsquo;tis hard to get it on;<br />
Not great men, even when they&rsquo;re good;<br />

Where everything is well and fair,<br />

Whose sweet subdual of the world<br />

Subjected to observances,<br />

<h4>GOING TO CHURCH.</h4>
<h5>1</h5>
<p class="poetry">I woke at three; for I was bid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To breakfast with the Dean at nine,<br />
And thence to Church.&nbsp; My curtain slid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I found the dawning Sunday fine,<br />
And could not rest, so rose.&nbsp; The air<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was dark and sharp; the roosted birds<br />
Cheep&rsquo;d, &lsquo;Here am I, Sweet; are you there?&rsquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; On Avon&rsquo;s misty flats the herds<br />
Expected, comfortless, the day,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which slowly fired the clouds above;<br />
The cock scream&rsquo;d, somewhere far away;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In sleep the matrimonial dove<br />
Was crooning; no wind waked the wood,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor moved the midnight river-damps,<br />
Nor thrill&rsquo;d the poplar; quiet stood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The chestnut with its thousand lamps;<br />
<a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>The moon
shone yet, but weak and drear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And seem&rsquo;d to watch, with bated breath,<br />
The landscape, all made sharp and clear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By stillness, as a face by death.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="poetry">My pray&rsquo;rs for her being done, I took<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Occasion by the quiet hour<br />
To find and know, by Rule and Book,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rights of love&rsquo;s beloved power.</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="poetry">Fronting the question without ruth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor ignorant that, evermore,<br />
If men will stoop to kiss the Truth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She lifts them higher than before,<br />
I, from above, such light required<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As now should once for all destroy<br />
The folly which at times desired<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A sanction for so great a joy.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="poetry">Thenceforth, and through that pray&rsquo;r, I
trod<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A path with no suspicions dim.<br />
I loved her in the name of God,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And for the ray she was of Him;<br />
<a name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>I ought to
admire much more, not less<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her beauty was a godly grace;<br />
The mystery of loveliness,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made an altar of her face,<br />
Was not of the flesh, though that was fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But a most pure and living light<br />
Without a name, by which the rare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And virtuous spirit flamed to sight.<br />
If oft, in love, effect lack&rsquo;d cause<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And cause effect, &rsquo;twere vain to soar<br />
Reasons to seek for that which was<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Reason itself, or something more.<br />
My joy was no idolatry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon the ends of the vile earth bent,<br />
For when I loved her most then I<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Most yearn&rsquo;d for more divine content.<br />
That other doubt, which, like a ghost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the brain&rsquo;s darkness haunted me,<br />
Was thus resolved: Him loved I most,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But her I loved most sensibly.<br />
Lastly, my giddiest hope allow&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; No selfish thought, or earthly smirch;<br />
And forth I went, in peace, and proud<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take my passion into Church;<br />
Grateful and glad to think that all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Such doubts would seem entirely vain<br />
To her whose nature&rsquo;s lighter fall<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made no divorce of heart from brain.</p>
<h5><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>5</h5>
<p class="poetry">I found them, with exactest grace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fresh as Spring, for Spring attired;<br />
And by the radiance in her face<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw she felt she was admired;<br />
And, through the common luck of love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment&rsquo;s fortunate delay,<br />
To fit the little lilac glove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gave me her arm; and I and they<br />
(They true to this and every hour,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if attended on by Time),<br />
Enter&rsquo;d the Church while yet the tower<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was noisy with the finish&rsquo;d chime.</p>
<h5>6</h5>
<p class="poetry">Her soft voice, singularly heard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beside me, in her chant, withstood<br />
The roar of voices, like a bird<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sole warbling in a windy wood;<br />
And, when we knelt, she seem&rsquo;d to be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An angel teaching me to pray;<br />
And all through the high Liturgy<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My spirit rejoiced without allay,<br />
Being, for once, borne clearly above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All banks and bars of ignorance,<br />
By this bright spring-tide of pure love,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And floated in a free expanse,<br />
<a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>Whence it
could see from side to side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The obscurity from every part<br />
Winnow&rsquo;d away and purified<br />

The rest, and does in her accept<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; O, sad one, with no more a name<br />
Or place in all the honour&rsquo;d host<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of maiden and of matron fame,<br />
Grieve on; but, if thou grievest right,<br />

Nor would&rsquo;st thou lower the least the height<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which makes thy casting down so great.<br />
Good is thy lot in its degree;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For hearts that verily repent<br />
Are burden&rsquo;d with impunity<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And comforted by chastisement.<br />
Sweet patience sanctify thy woes!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And doubt not but our God is just,<br />
Albeit unscathed thy traitor goes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And thou art stricken to the dust.<br />
That penalty&rsquo;s the best to bear<br />

He wakes renew&rsquo;d for all the smart.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His only Love, and she is wed!<br />
His fondness comes about his heart,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As milk comes, when the babe is dead.<br />
The wretch, whom she found fit for scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His own allegiant thoughts despise;<br />
And far into the shining morn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lazy with misery he lies.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor from its very want of bound.<br />
My queen was crouching at my side,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; By love unsceptred and brought low,<br />
Her awful garb of maiden pride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All melted into tears like snow;<br />
The mistress of my reverent thought,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whose praise was all I ask&rsquo;d of fame,<br />
In my close-watch&rsquo;d approval sought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Protection as from danger and blame;<br />
Her soul, which late I loved to invest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With pity for my poor desert,<br />
Buried its face within my breast,<br />

Nay, could eternal life afford<br />

From this fair land, which call&rsquo;d me lord,<br />

It might not and it should not be!<br />

Its bright feet lit the hill and wood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beyond, and cloud and sward were dark;<br />
And I, who thought the splendour ours<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Because the place was, t&rsquo;wards it flew,<br />
And there, amidst the glittering showers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gazed vainly for the glorious view.<br />
With whatsoever&rsquo;s lovely, know<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It is not ours; stand off to see,<br />
Or beauty&rsquo;s apparition so<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Loved once, for what I never knew,<br />
Unless for colouring in her talk,<br />

Three roses on a single stalk,<br />

One of those lovely things she was<br />

Nothing so transient but it has<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; An air of immortality.<br />

Around her mouth the baby smile<br />

Her ball-dress seem&rsquo;d a breathing mist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From the fair form exhaled and shed,<br />
Raised in the dance with arm and wrist<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; All warmth and light, unbraceleted.<br />
Her motion, feeling &rsquo;twas beloved,<br />

And, oh, what perfume, as she moved,<br />

How sweet a tongue the music had!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;Beautiful Girl,&rsquo; it seem&rsquo;d to

Ah, none but I discern&rsquo;d her looks,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When in the throng she pass&rsquo;d me by,<br />
For love is like a ghost, and brooks<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Only the chosen seer&rsquo;s eye;<br />
And who but she could e&rsquo;er divine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The halo and the happy trance,<br />
When her bright arm reposed on mine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In all the pauses of the dance!</p>

And was it like the Pharisee<br />

With joyful thanks that I should be,<br />

And fortune of well-nurtured youth,<br />

I, who in manhood&rsquo;s name at length<br />

The gross regality of strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Must yet in this thy praise abate,<br />
That, through thine erring humbleness<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And disregard of thy degree,<br />
Mainly, has man been so much less<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than fits his fellowship with thee.<br />
High thoughts had shaped the foolish brow,<br />

<p class="poetry">I conn&rsquo;d a scheme, within mind elate:<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; My Uncle&rsquo;s land would fall to me,<br />
My skill was much in school debate,<br />

A place in Parliament once gain&rsquo;d,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thro&rsquo; saps first labour&rsquo;d out of

Which did not help my settled will<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To earn the Statesman&rsquo;s proud applause.<br />

That sensitive appetency<br />

Took Blackstone down, only to draw<br />

To love, which is the source of law,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And, like a king, can do no wrong;<br />
Then open&rsquo;d Hyde, where loyal hearts,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With faith unpropp&rsquo;d by precedent,<br />
Began to play rebellious parts.<br />

So loosed my chafing thoughts from school,<br />

Unless Love&rsquo;s toil has love for prize,<br />

No fault of Love&rsquo;s, but nature&rsquo;s laws!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; No love was lost, for I could see<br />

<p class="poetry">I loiter&rsquo;d through the vacant house,<br

&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon to be her&rsquo;s; in one room stay&rsquo;d,<br

Of old my mother&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Here my vows<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of endless thanks were oftenest paid.<br />
This room its first condition kept;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, on her road to Sarum Town,<br />
Therein an English Queen had slept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Hurst was half pull&rsquo;d down.<br />
The pictured walls the place became:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Here ran the Brook Anaurus, where<br />
Stout Jason bore the wrinkled dame<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Whom serving changed to Juno; there,<br />
Ixion&rsquo;s selfish hope, instead<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the nuptial goddess, clasp&rsquo;d a cloud;<br />
And, here, translated Psyche fed<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her gaze on Love, not disallow&rsquo;d.</p>

<p class="poetry">And in this chamber had she been,<br />

I scarcely can myself recall<br />

And how more sweet than aught below,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The daylight and its duties done,<br />
It felt to fold the hands, and so<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Relinquish all regards but one;<br />
To see her features in the dark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To lie and meditate once more<br />
The grace I did not fully mark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The tone I had not heard before;<br />
And from my pillow then to take<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her notes, her picture, and her glove,<br />
Put there for joy when I should wake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And press them to the heart of love;<br />
And then to whisper &lsquo;Wife!&rsquo; and pray<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To live so long as not to miss<br />
That unimaginable day<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which farther seems the nearer &rsquo;tis;<br />
And still from joy&rsquo;s unfathom&rsquo;d well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To drink, in dreams, while on her brows<br />
Of innocence ineffable<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Blossom&rsquo;d the laughing bridal rose.</p>

<i>Love&rsquo;s Perversity</i>.</h5>
<p class="poetry"><span class="smcap">How</span> strange a thing
a lover seems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To animals that do not love!<br />
Lo, where he walks and talks in dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And flouts us with his Lady&rsquo;s glove;<br />
How foreign is the garb he wears;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And how his great devotion mocks<br />
Our poor propriety, and scares<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The undevout with paradox!<br />
His soul, through scorn of worldly care,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And great extremes of sweet and gall,<br />
And musing much on all that&rsquo;s fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Grows witty and fantastical;<br />
He sobs his joy and sings his grief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And evermore finds such delight<br />
In simply picturing his relief,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That &rsquo;plaining seems to cure his plight;<br />
<a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>He makes
his sorrow, when there&rsquo;s none;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His fancy blows both cold and hot;<br />
Next to the wish that she&rsquo;ll be won,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His first hope is that she may not;<br />
He sues, yet deprecates consent;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Would she be captured she must fly;<br />
She looks too happy and content,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For whose least pleasure he would die;<br />
Oh, cruelty, she cannot care<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For one to whom she&rsquo;s always kind!<br />
He says he&rsquo;s nought, but, oh, despair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If he&rsquo;s not Jove to her fond mind!<br />
He&rsquo;s jealous if she pets a dove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She must be his with all her soul;<br />
Yet &rsquo;tis a postulate in love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That part is greater than the whole;<br />
And all his apprehension&rsquo;s stress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When he&rsquo;s with her, regards her hair,<br />
Her hand, a ribbon of her dress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As if his life were only there;<br />
Because she&rsquo;s constant, he will change,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And kindest glances coldly meet,<br />
And, all the time he seems so strange,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His soul is fawning at her feet;<br />
Of smiles and simple heaven grown tired,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He wickedly provokes her tears,<br />
And when she weeps, as he desired,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Falls slain with ecstasies of fears;<br />
<a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>He
blames her, though she has no fault,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Except the folly to be his;<br />
He worships her, the more to exalt<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The profanation of a kiss;<br />
Health&rsquo;s his disease, he&rsquo;s never well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when his paleness shames her rose;<br />
His faith&rsquo;s a rock-built citadel,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its sign a flag that each way blows;<br />
His o&rsquo;erfed fancy frets and fumes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And Love, in him, is fierce, like Hate,<br />
And ruffles his ambrosial plumes<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Against the bars of time and fate.</p>

Nature to you was more than kind;<br />

So much simplicity of mind<br />

<p class="poetry">Frank&rsquo;s long, dull letter, lying by<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The gay sash from Honoria&rsquo;s waist,<br />
Reproach&rsquo;d me; passion spared a sigh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For friendship without fault disgraced.<br />
How should I greet him? how pretend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt the love he once inspired?<br />
Time was when either, in his friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His own deserts with joy admired;<br />
We took one side in school-debate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Like hopes pursued with equal thirst,<br />
Were even-bracketed by Fate,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Twin-Wranglers, seventh from the First;<br />
And either loved a lady&rsquo;s laugh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; More than all music; he and I<br />
Were perfect in the pleasant half<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of universal charity.</p>

<p class="poetry">From pride of likeness thus I loved<br />

was the pride of feeling so<br />

<p class="poetry">Frank follow&rsquo;d in his letter&rsquo;s
track,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And set my guilty heart at ease<br />
By echoing my excuses back<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With just the same apologies.<br />
So he had slighted me as well!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor was my mind disburthen&rsquo;d less<br />
When what I sought excuse to tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He of himself did first confess.</p>

<p class="poetry">Each, rapturous, praised his lady&rsquo;s

To which she leads me by the hand;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, briefly all the truth to say<br />
To you, who briefly understand,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She is both heaven and the way.<br />
Displeasures and resentments pass<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Athwart her charitable eyes<br />
More fleetingly than breath from glass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or truth from foolish memories;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; Like God&rsquo;s commandments, with content,<br />
And make an aspect calm and gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where sweet affections come and go,<br />
Till all who see her, smile and say,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; How fair, and happy that she&rsquo;s so!<br />
She is so lovely, true, and pure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her virtue virtue so endears,<br />
That often, when I think of her,<br />

tears&mdash;&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;You paint Miss Churchill!&nbsp; Pray go
on&mdash;&rsquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;She&rsquo;s perfect, and, if joy was much<br

In joy&rsquo;s crown danced the feather jest,<br />

Clasp&rsquo;d hands, less shy than words, confess&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We had not been true friends before.</p>

Without avail!&nbsp; O&rsquo;erwhelming wealth,<br />

And I rehears&rsquo;d my marriage vow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And swore her welfare to prefer<br />
To all things, and for aye as now<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To live, not for myself, but her.<br />
Forth, from the glittering spirit&rsquo;s peace<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gaiety ineffable,<br />
Stream&rsquo;d to the heart delight and ease,<br />

And, orderly deriving thence<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Its pleasure perfect and allow&rsquo;d,<br />
Bright with the spirit shone the sense,<br />

Amaze thy brain, scorn not the Priest<br />

<p class="poetry">I, while the shop-girl fitted on<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sand-shoes, look&rsquo;d where, down the bay,<br
/>
The sea glow&rsquo;d with a shrouded sun.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m ready, Felix; will you
pay?&rsquo;<br />
That was my first expense for this<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sweet Stranger, now my three days&rsquo; Wife.<br />
How light the touches are that kiss<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The music from the chords of life!</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="poetry">Her feet, by half-a-mile of sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In spotless sand left shapely prints;<br />
With agates, then, she loaded me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (The lapidary call&rsquo;d them flints);<br />
<a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>Then, at
her wish, I hail&rsquo;d a boat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To take her to the ships-of-war,<br />
At anchor, each a lazy mote<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Black in the brilliance, miles from shore.</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="poetry">The morning breeze the canvas fill&rsquo;d,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Lifting us o&rsquo;er the bright-ridged gulf,<br />
And every lurch my darling thrill&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With light fear smiling at itself;<br />
And, dashing past the Arrogant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Asleep upon the restless wave<br />
After its cruise in the Levant,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We reach&rsquo;d the Wolf, and signal gave<br />
For help to board; within caution meet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My bride was placed within the chair,<br />
The red flag wrapp&rsquo;d about her feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And so swung laughing through the air.</p>
<h5>4</h5>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Look, Love,&rsquo; she said,
&lsquo;there&rsquo;s Frederick Graham,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My cousin, whom you met, you know,&rsquo;<br />
And seeing us, the brave man came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And made his frank and courteous bow,<br />
And gave my hand a sailor&rsquo;s shake,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And said, &lsquo;You ask&rsquo;d me to the Hurst:<br
/>
I never thought my luck would make<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Your wife and you my guests the first.&rsquo;<br />
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>And
Honor, cruel, &lsquo;Nor did we:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you not lately changed your ship?&rsquo;<br />
&lsquo;Yes: I&rsquo;m Commander, now,&rsquo; said he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a slight quiver of the lip.<br />
We saw the vessel, shown with pride;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Took luncheon; I must eat his salt!<br />
Parting he said, (I fear my bride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Found him unselfish to a fault),<br />
His wish, he saw, had come to pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (And so, indeed, her face express&rsquo;d),<br />
That that should be, whatever &rsquo;twas,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Which made his Cousin happiest.<br />
We left him looking from above;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich bankrupt! for he could afford<br />
To say most proudly that his love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Was virtue and its own reward.<br />
But others loved as well as he,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; (Thought I, half-anger&rsquo;d), and if fate,<br />
Unfair, had only fashion&rsquo;d me<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As hapless, I had been as great.</p>
<h5>5</h5>
<p class="poetry">As souls, ambitious, but low-born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; If raised past hope by luck or wit,<br />
All pride of place will proudly scorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And live as they&rsquo;d been used to it,<br />
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>So we
two wore our strange estate:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Familiar, unaffected, free,<br />
We talk&rsquo;d, until the dusk grew late,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of this and that; but, after tea,<br />
As doubtful if a lot so sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; As ours was ours in very sooth,<br />
Like children, to promote conceit,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We feign&rsquo;d that it was not the truth;<br />
And she assumed the maiden coy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I adored remorseless charms,<br />
And then we clapp&rsquo;d our hands for joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And ran into each others arms.</p>
<h4><a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>THE
EPILOGUE.</h4>
<h5>I</h5>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Ah</span>, dearest
Wife, a fresh-lit fire<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sends forth to heaven great shows of fume,<br />
And watchers, far away, admire;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But when the flames their power assume,<br />
The more they burn the less they show,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The clouds no longer smirch the sky,<br />
And then the flames intensest glow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When far-off watchers think they die.<br />
The fumes of early love my verse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has figured&mdash;&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;You must
paint the flame!&rsquo;<br />
&rsquo;Twould merit the Promethean curse!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But now, Sweet, for your praise and blame.&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;You speak too boldly; veils are due<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To women&rsquo;s feelings.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Fear
not this!<br />
Women will vow I say not true,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And men believe thine lips they kiss.&rsquo;<br />
I did not call you &ldquo;Dear&rdquo; or &ldquo;Love,&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;I think, till after Frank was born.&rsquo;<br
/>
&lsquo;That fault I cannot well remove;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The rhymes&rsquo;&mdash;but Frank now blew his
horn,<br />
And Walter bark&rsquo;d, on hands and knees,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Baby in the mignonette,<br />
And all made, full-cry, for the trees<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Where Felix and his Wife were set.<br />
<a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Again
disturb&rsquo;d, (crickets have cares!)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; True to their annual use they rose,<br />
To offer thanks at Evening Prayers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In three times sacred Sarum Close.</p>
<h5>2</h5>
<p class="poetry">Passing, they left a gift of wine<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; At Widow Neale&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Her daughter said:<br
/>
&lsquo;O, Ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;s sinking!&nbsp; For a sign,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; She cried just now, of him that&rsquo;s dead,<br />
&ldquo;Mary, he&rsquo;s somewhere close above,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Weeping and wailing his dead wife,<br />
With forceful prayers and fatal love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Conjuring me to come to life.<br />
A spirit is terrible though dear!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It comes by night, and sucks my breath,<br />
And draws me with desire and fear.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah, Ma&rsquo;am, she&rsquo;ll soon be his in
death!&rsquo;</p>
<h5>3</h5>
<p class="poetry">Vaughan, when his kind Wife&rsquo;s eyes were
dry,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Said, &lsquo;This thought crosses me, my Dove;<br />
If Heaven should proffer, when we die,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Some unconceiv&rsquo;d, superior love,<br />
<a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>How take
the exchange without despair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Without worse folly how refuse?&rsquo;<br />
But she, who, wise as she was fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For subtle doubts had simple clues,<br />
Said, &lsquo;Custom sanctifies, and faith<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Is more than joy: ah, how desire<br />
In any heaven a different path,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though, found at first, it had been higher?<br />
Yet love makes death a dreadful thought!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Felix, at what a price we live!&rsquo;<br />
But present pleasures soon forgot<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The future&rsquo;s dread alternative;<br />
For, as became the festal time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He cheer&rsquo;d her heart with tender praise,<br />
And speeches wanting only rhyme<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To make them like his winged lays.<br />
He discommended girlhood.&nbsp; &lsquo;What<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For sweetness like the ten-years&rsquo; wife,<br />
Whose customary love is not<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her passion, or her play, but life?<br />
With beauties so maturely fair,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Affecting, mild, and manifold,<br />
May girlish charms mo more compare<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than apples green with apples gold.<br />
Ah, still unpraised Honoria, Heaven,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When you into my arms it gave,<br />
Left nought hereafter to be given<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But grace to feel the good I have.&rsquo;</p>
<h5><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>4</h5>
<p class="poetry">Her own and manhood&rsquo;s modesty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Made dumb her love, but, on their road,<br />
His hand in hers felt soft reply,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And like rejoinder found bestow&rsquo;d;<br />
And, when the carriage set them down,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &lsquo;How strange,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;&rsquo;twould seem to meet,<br />
When pacing, as we now this town,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A Florence or a Lisbon Street,<br />
That Laura or that Catherine, who,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the remote, romantic years,<br />
From Petrarch or Camoens drew<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their songs and their immortal tears!&rsquo;<br />
But here their converse had its end;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For, crossing the Cathedral Lawn,<br />
There came an ancient college-friend,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who, introduced to Mrs. Vaughan,<br />
Lifted his hat, and bow&rsquo;d and smiled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fill&rsquo;d her kind large eyes with joy,<br />
By patting on the cheek her child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With, &lsquo;Is he yours, this handsome
boy?&rsquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
